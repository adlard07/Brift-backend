Here's a complete `README.md` file for your **SpendWise** backend project, built using **FastAPI**, deployed on a **serverless architecture**, and integrated with **Firebase Firestore** as the database.

This README assumes you've structured your code following best practices (e.g., modular routes, services, Firestore clients, auth middlewares, etc.), and you have a deployment setup like **Google Cloud Functions**, **Vercel Serverless Functions**, or **AWS Lambda via Zappa or Serverless Framework**.
