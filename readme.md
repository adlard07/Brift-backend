### Querying and Custom Functions
To enable efficient querying and retrieval, Firestoreâ€™s **subcollections** structure ensures that:
- Expenses, budgets, income, and goals are **easily accessible per user**.
- Queries can be **optimized using Firestore indexes**.
- Custom functions can filter **expenses by category, date range, or budget limits**.
- Aggregations can be performed using **Firebase Cloud Functions** for advanced analytics.

This schema is designed for scalability, ensuring efficient data organization and querying within Firestore.
